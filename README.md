## ⚠️ Important Notice: `.env` File

The `.env` file contains sensitive information, such as your database credentials, which should **never** be pushed to public repositories or shared with others.

Although I have included this file for convenience to make it easier for you to get started, you should **never** use the provided credentials in production.

### 🔒 Never Push `.env` to GitHub
Before contributing or pushing your changes, make sure that the `.env` file is added to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being accidentally committed to the repository.
